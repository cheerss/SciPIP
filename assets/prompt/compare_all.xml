### Comparison Standard:
"""
**Novelty**: It assesses the degree to which the method presents novel ideas or transformative strategies that challenge conventional practices, fostering advancements in the field and inspiring future research directions.
**Feasibility**: It examines the practicality and implementability of the method, ensuring that the required resources, time, and expertise are realistically available for its execution within the constraints of the study environment.
**Clarity**: It evaluates whether the method is articulated in a straightforward and coherent manner, facilitating a comprehensive understanding for both practitioners and researchers, thus enabling effective application and potential adaptation in similar studies.
**Generalizability**: It determines how broadly the method can be extended or adapted to various contexts, populations, or situations, evaluating its applicability beyond the specific conditions of the study while maintaining relevance and effectiveness.
"""

### You should compare these five ideas:
"""IDEA1
{idea1}
"""
"""IDEA2
{idea2}
"""

### Respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
```thought
&lt; THOUGHT &gt;
```

RESPONSE:
```json
&lt; JSON &gt;
```

In &lt; THOUGHT &gt; , You can record your reasoning process and explain why you think the idea is better in each aspect in detail to make your comparison more organized.

In &lt; JSON &gt; , respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:
- "Novelty": Provide an array consisting of 1 and 2, representing each idea separately, with the better idea placed at the beginning (e.g. [1, 2]).
- "Feasibility": Same as above.
- "clarity": Same as above.
- "Generalizability": Same as above.
- "Overall Ranking": Same as above.


This THOUGHT and JSON will be automatically parsed, so ensure the format is precise.
