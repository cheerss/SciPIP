# Task Description:
You are an AI researcher conducting studies in a specific domain. Someone has provided you with a methodology section, and your task is to transform it into another style. I will give you an example. The example begins with "# Example 1" and includes a Example Summarized Methods. Then, your task starts with "# Your Task", containing "Your Methodology Section". Your job is to transform Your Methodology Section into a Summarized Methods by referring to Example 1. Note that the ideas in Example 1 are unrelated to your idea, so the key focus should be on the style of Example Summarized Methods. You should directly start with your response and do not start with a section title like "## Your Summarized Methods".

# Example 1

## Example Summarized Methods

Building on the concept of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), which aims to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks without the full computational cost of training all parameters, the following algorithm integrates a memory-efficient strategy enhanced through quantization and an auxiliary side network. This allows for efficient fine-tuning and inference on large models with reduced memory requirements and computational demands.

1. **Quantization of LLM to 4-bit Precision:**
   1. Utilize 4-bit quantization to reduce the memory footprint of the LLM's weights. Each floating-point parameter in the LLM is converted to a 4-bit representation for efficient memory utilization.
   2. Begin with the conversion of 16-bit parameters to 4-bit using the relation:
      \[
      X_{{4bit}} = \text{{round}}\left(\frac{{M_{{4bit}}}}{{\text{{Absmax}}(X_{{16bit}})}} \cdot X_{{16bit}}\right)
      \]
      where \(M_{{4bit}}\) is the maximum value representable in 4 bits, ensuring quantization minimizes precision loss by managing outliers through block-wise separate quantization.

2. **Side Network for Memory-Efficient Tuning:**
   1. Implement a side network \(g\) with dimensions reduced by a factor \(r\) relative to the original model \(f\). The side network processes information more economically, storing less data and reducing computational load during training.
   2. Define the hidden state transformation at the \(i\)-th layer as:
      \[
      h_{{gi}}^{{16bit}} = (1 - \beta_i) * \text{{downsample}}_i(h_{{fi}}^{{16bit}}) + \beta_i * h_{{gi-1}}^{{16bit}}
      \]
      where \(\beta_i\) is a learnable gating parameter and \(\text{{downsample}}_i\) reduces dimensionality.

3. **Low-Memory Gradient Calculation:**
   1. Perform backpropagation limited to the side network \(g\), excluding the calculation of gradients for the quantized weights in \)f\), leveraging the pre-trained knowledge while focusing computational resources on the task-specific adaptation.
   2. The gradient computation is detached from the main LLM, avoiding the costly backpropagation through large transformer layers and focusing updates through efficient gradient paths within \(g\).

4. **Combining Outputs for Inference:**
   1. At inference, blend the outputs from the LLM and side network as a weighted sum:
      \[
      h_N^{{16bit}} = \alpha h_{{fN}}^{{16bit}} + (1-\alpha) h_{{gN}}^{{16bit}}
      \]
      where \(\alpha\) is a learnable parameter initialized to prioritize the pre-trained model influence gradually allowing task customization through tuning.

5. **Optimized Training Procedure:**
   1. Integrate efficient downsampling techniques, such as LoRA and Adapter models, reducing parameter size significantly without losing efficacy.
   2. Maintain a 16-bit floating-point data type for computations in forward and backward passes to balance precision and performance, ensuring that the quantized network remains robust and generalizable.

By synthesizing quantization with an auxiliary network, the algorithm achieves a robust parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, significantly reducing memory overhead, improving inference speed, and maintaining high performance despite the minimal parameters being updated. This approach effectively supports large-scale models, facilitating application in environments with constrained computational resources.
