### Comparison Standard:
"""
**Feasibility**: It examines the practicality and implementability of the method, ensuring that the required resources, time, and expertise are realistically available for its execution within the constraints of the study environment.
"""

### You should compare these five ideas:
"""IDEA1
{idea1}
"""
"""IDEA2
{idea2}
"""

### Respond in the following format:

THOUGHT:
```thought
&lt; THOUGHT &gt;
```

RESPONSE:
```json
&lt; JSON &gt;
```

In &lt; THOUGHT &gt;, You can record your reasoning process and explain why you think the idea is better in each aspect in detail to make your comparison more organized.

In &lt; JSON &gt;, respond in JSON format with ONLY the following field:
- "Feasibility": Provide an array consisting of 1 and 2, representing each idea separately, with the better idea placed at the beginning (e.g. [1, 2]).

This THOUGHT and JSON will be automatically parsed, so ensure the format is precise and don't forget the label "Feasibility".
