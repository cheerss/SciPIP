# Task Description:
You are an AI researcher conducting studies in a specific domain. Someone has provided you with a brief scientific idea, and your task is to transform it into a detailed, feasible, and concrete algorithm. If necessary, you may incorporate formulas to elaborate on the algorithm in the Latex format. I will give you an example. The example begins with "# Example 1" and includes a Brief Scientific Idea and its corresponding Detailed Scientific Idea. Then, your task starts with "# Your Task", containing "Your Brief Scientific Idea". Your job is to expand Your Brief Scientific Idea into a Detailed Scientific Idea by referring to Example 1. Note that the ideas in Example 1 are unrelated to your idea, so the key focus should be on the relationship between the Brief Scientific Idea and the Detailed Scientific Idea. You should directly start with your response and do not start with a section title like "## Detailed Scientific Idea". 

# Example 1

## Example Brief Scientific Idea

1. The use of a dual-stage process that first quantizes the LLM's model weights into 4-bit and then introduces a side network that leverages downsampled outputs and hidden states from the quantized LLM to make task-specific predictions.
2. The innovative application of several low-rank adapter methods, such as MaxPooling and AvgPooling, within the side network to perform downsampling and significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters and the memory footprint of optimizer states.
3. The aggregation of hidden states from the quantized LLM and the side network using a learnable parameter, which allows for efficient parallel computation of the LLM and side network without increasing inference latency.

## Example Detailed Scientific Idea

Building on the concept of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), which aims to adapt Large Language Models (LLMs) to specific tasks without the full computational cost of training all parameters, the following algorithm integrates a memory-efficient strategy enhanced through quantization and an auxiliary side network. This allows for efficient fine-tuning and inference on large models with reduced memory requirements and computational demands.

1. **Quantization of LLM to 4-bit Precision:**
   1. Utilize 4-bit quantization to reduce the memory footprint of the LLM's weights. Each floating-point parameter in the LLM is converted to a 4-bit representation for efficient memory utilization.
   2. Begin with the conversion of 16-bit parameters to 4-bit using the relation:
      $$
      X_{{4bit}} = \text{{round}}\left(\frac{{M_{{4bit}}}}{{\text{{Absmax}}(X_{{16bit}})}} \cdot X_{{16bit}}\right)
      $$
      where $M_{{4bit}}$ is the maximum value representable in 4 bits, ensuring quantization minimizes precision loss by managing outliers through block-wise separate quantization.

2. **Side Network for Memory-Efficient Tuning:**
   1. Implement a side network $g$ with dimensions reduced by a factor $r$ relative to the original model $f$. The side network processes information more economically, storing less data and reducing computational load during training.
   2. Define the hidden state transformation at the $i$-th layer as:
      $$
      h_{{gi}}^{{16bit}} = (1 - \beta_i) * \text{{downsample}}_i(h_{{fi}}^{{16bit}}) + \beta_i * h_{{gi-1}}^{{16bit}}
      $$
      where $\beta_i$ is a learnable gating parameter and $\text{{downsample}}_i$ reduces dimensionality.

3. **Low-Memory Gradient Calculation:**
   1. Perform backpropagation limited to the side network $g$, excluding the calculation of gradients for the quantized weights in $f$, leveraging the pre-trained knowledge while focusing computational resources on the task-specific adaptation.
   2. The gradient computation is detached from the main LLM, avoiding the costly backpropagation through large transformer layers and focusing updates through efficient gradient paths within $g$.

4. **Combining Outputs for Inference:**
   1. At inference, blend the outputs from the LLM and side network as a weighted sum:
      $$
      h_N^{{16bit}} = \alpha h_{{fN}}^{{16bit}} + (1-\alpha) h_{{gN}}^{{16bit}}
      $$
      where $\alpha$ is a learnable parameter initialized to prioritize the pre-trained model influence gradually allowing task customization through tuning.

5. **Optimized Training Procedure:**
   1. Integrate efficient downsampling techniques, such as LoRA and Adapter models, reducing parameter size significantly without losing efficacy.
   2. Maintain a 16-bit floating-point data type for computations in forward and backward passes to balance precision and performance, ensuring that the quantized network remains robust and generalizable.

By synthesizing quantization with an auxiliary network, the algorithm achieves a robust parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique, significantly reducing memory overhead, improving inference speed, and maintaining high performance despite the minimal parameters being updated. This approach effectively supports large-scale models, facilitating application in environments with constrained computational resources.
