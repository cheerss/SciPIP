The need to trace back and understand which training data influences specific generations in large language models for tasks like risk assessment, model retraining, and improving explainability. \n2. The challenge of scaling existing influence estimation methods to large language models due to their massive size and the computational expense of processing and storing gradients."

The desire to align theoretical insights from linguistics with the methodological sophistication of natural language processing to better understand social and cultural change."
