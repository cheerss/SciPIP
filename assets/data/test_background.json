{"background": "The application scope of large-scale language models such as GPT-4 and LLaMA has rapidly expanded, demonstrating powerful capabilities in natural language processing and multimodal tasks. However, as the size and complexity of the models increase, understanding how they make decisions becomes increasingly difficult. Challenge: 1 The complexity of model interpretation: The billions of parameters and nonlinear decision paths within large-scale language models make it very difficult to track and interpret specific outputs. The existing interpretation methods usually only provide a local perspective and are difficult to systematize. 2. Transparency and Fairness: In specific scenarios, models may exhibit biased or discriminatory behavior. Ensuring the transparency of these models, reducing bias, and providing credible explanations is one of the current challenges."},
{"background": "Multimodal learning is committed to integrating multiple information sources such as text, images, audio, and video to create more powerful and universal AI models. The research on unified representation aims to find representation methods that can generalize across modalities. Challenge: 1 Modal alignment: There is heterogeneity between different modalities, and how to achieve semantic alignment of these modalities to ensure that the model can comprehensively understand different types of data is a core challenge. 2. Data sparsity and imbalance: There is usually an imbalance in the amount of data in different modalities, such as video and audio data being relatively scarce, while text data is relatively abundant. How to effectively utilize and fuse these modalities to avoid overfitting or underfitting remains a research difficulty.", "cue_words": ["cross-modal embedding", "dat augmentation", "modality-aware fusion", "heterogeneous data integration"]}]
